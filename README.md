# DroppoCoffee
The purpose of this project is to have some experience creating an ecommerce site, with a group of student in the Database Management course, that works locally with MySQL and it was made using PHP, HTML and CSS. The name of our project is Dropo. Coffee and we focused on selling native coffee brand from our Island, Puerto Rico.

This project let users browse, sort and search for coffee, but if the user wants to buy an item, he will need to have an account to checkout. Also, thereâ€™s an administrator page that can manage the inventory, have reports of sold, return and remaining items, and can manage all the customer that have an account.
